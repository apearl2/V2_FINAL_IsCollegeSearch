# V2_FINAL_IsCollegeSearch
Custom college search web application made with Flask


Project Timeline:

9/30 - Create user interface for Intended major, and safety attributes, basic UI

10/1 - Add tuition cutoff, generate report in console for selected attributes, started to work on storing importance values as variables

10/2 - More work on importance

10/3 - Download PyCharm

10/5-10/6 - Importance radio value works, begin learning about web scraping using Beautiful soup

10/13- Ability to search google and get any desired URL (CODE REUSABILITY), beginning to parse HTML data from Princeton Review (Niche doesnâ€™t work yet) using python string methods

10/14 - Finish string methods for rankings, final list generated for any Princeton Review ranking (with about 4 errors per 25)

10/19 -> Created function to create finalList to assign names and points (works for 2 lists so far) and cleaned up main function as well as ----Errors in list

10/20 -> Revised rankingA() function to ensure all colleges (tested with 4 PrincetonReview functions) are show in finalList once with their proper values #And started making code to return ordered list of College Factual Rankings (turns out to be way easier than Princeton Review)

10/21 -> Built CollegeFactual() function up to generating a newrankList

10/24 -> rankingA() now works with CollegeFactual Function, Started working with Flask

10/26 -> Started more learning about flask, reportA() function works for first~20 colleges

10/27 -> averageA() functions works all the time now, began working on way to join the two lists from C and P together

10/30 -> converted college variables from CF and P functions to uniform strings

10/31 -> Video of current functionality

11/2 -> (Marked as ### in program) Used functionality of listA() function combined with google to compile complete lists of all colleges that might come up, and then now able to convert them without using google #Program now runs (with all 14 attributes) in about 45 seconds

11-3 -> Add project to GitHub, first Flask project with user input

11/4 -> Began building first HTML templates and putting rest of python into Flask program Downloaded python 3.13.0 (previously using python 3.8) Whole program works with first 3 college factual attributes

11/5 -> Put rest of attributes (P) into front end #TODO figure out way to ensure calculate() function gets all attribute selections before running content of function Might have to break up HTML pages to run CF, and then P attributes Could be recording everything past main url as string, then using string methods Research more on Request library from Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#flask.Request

11/6 -> Revised method for taking input broken into 3 page stages: home, in_progress, and results. New structure now works for all 3 college factual attributes

11/7 -> Created called variable to ensure string is only split when CF/P functions are actually New structure works through joinA() for all 14 attributes.

11/8 - Created pythonanywhere account, username: iscollegesearch

11/9 - Entire program works, now improving accuracy on P ultiStr searching (Some attributes are missed) Accuracy improved

11/10 - Released full program on pythonanywhere, now dealing with many logical errors First - fixed error with averageA, fixed CF / 2 error, reset all variables

11/11 - Top 10/top 20 option added, reset more, pythonanywhere website working better

11/13 - Began researching next sources CollegeVine (Like P structure) -> for intendMajor Research CollegeTransitions (all from blog, but uniform HTMl structure) -> for Career services, college town

11/14 - Started working on filter List by acceptance rates Works in trial with list of up to 4 and few attributes

11/16- Updated UI Added acceptance rate filter to website (still is very slow) More learning with github		

11/18 - Added Favicon to site
		Started dictionary to store schools/acceptance rates
  
11/19 - Finished dictionary for about 40 schools
		Worked on fixing line 621 bug

11/21 - able to scrape CF for undergrad pop now (does not work when aRate already found, though, yet)

11/25 - Undergrad pop filter works in PA tests

11/30 - Finalized GoDaddy all domain settings, now waiting for changes published
	(Website will be blocked on chromebook for next 10 days)

12/1 - collegeVine function for research works in PyCharm

12/3 - CF/CV corroboration fully programmed, not tested fully yet

12/7 - Finished testing corroboration, Started way to add zeros to schools already in list, not fully working yet

12/10 - Built separate lists with proper zeros for CV/CF and P, not combined yet

12/18 - Outlined plan for final steps needed to publish v2

12/30 - Started Final Report (with zeros) in PyCharm. More of a permanent solution to input string error on PA. 

12/31 - Finished Final Report, matched code from PC to PA. Mostly fixed duplicates in final list on PA version. 

1/1 - Continued working on bug fixes, Final Report now works once on PA. Manually added more colleges to aRateDict and sizeDict

1/2 - Final code inputted in PythonAnywhere, including random name algorithm for creating specialAreport files
